This is a simple project made by HTML and CSS. The main motive of this project was to implement the flex-property of CSS and make a basic Netflix look alike clone. The project showcases basic responsivity of the site such as buttons changing colours when the pointer hovers on them and the basic frontend with basic CSS only.
